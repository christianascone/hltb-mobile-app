## Requirements
- Node
- Npm or Yarn
- Watchman
- React Native CLI

Take a look at React native [Getting started](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) page.

It has been tested with `yarn 1.10.1` and `React Native CLI 2.0.1`.

## Installation

Install dependencies using yarn or npm

```sh
yarn install
```
or
```sh
npm install
```


## Bootstrap

Now you can run the packager using yarn or npm

```sh
yarn start
```
or
```sh
npm start
```

Finally, while you keep this packager running, you can run the app on iOS or Android device.

```sh
react-native run-ios
react-native run-android
```
